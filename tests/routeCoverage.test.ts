/**
 * The regression guard for the retail system's worst flaw.
 *
 * In the retail POS, protection is applied per route by hand, which means it is *forgotten* per
 * route by hand — and a forgotten guard is invisible. Nothing errors, nothing logs, the screen
 * works; the endpoint is simply open, and stays open until somebody notices. There is no way to
 * spot that by reading a diff, because the bug is a line that is not there.
 *
 * So it is asserted mechanically. This walks the real route table, enumerates every mounted
 * (method, path), and fails the build if any of them lacks `authenticate` or
 * `requirePermission`. Adding an unguarded endpoint stops being a silent mistake and becomes a
 * red test.
 *
 * Everything intentionally ungated is listed below with a stated reason. That list is the point
 * of the whole file: exemptions have to be *argued for* in a place reviewers read, rather than
 * being the accidental default.
